<h1>Vidyacraft Season 5 Setup Instructions</h1>

First thing's first, <b>you can use a completely vanilla (default) version of minecraft</b> but the intended way is to use one of the following modpacks:

<ul>
    <li><b>VG-S5: <a href=""></a></b> The standard way to play (choose this one if you're unsure)</li>
    <li><b>VG-S5 (optifine):</b> Same as VG-S5, just using optifine instead of iris for shaders. Only use this pack if you are sure you'll need it as it runs slower.</li>
</ul>
